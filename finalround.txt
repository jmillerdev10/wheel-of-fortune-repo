Congratulations on making it to the Final Round, %s! 

For the final round, we will put a word up on the board and reveal
the letters, R S T L and E, should any of these letters be in
the final puzzle. You will then have an opportunity to guess
the word.

If you are correct, you will take home the Grand Prize of $%s,
in addition to the $%s in winnings that you won during the 
earlier rounds. 

Are you ready to go?
